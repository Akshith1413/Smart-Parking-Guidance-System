# Smart Parking Guidance System

A real-time parking slot monitoring system built with STM32F401CCU6 microcontroller that uses ultrasonic and IR sensors to detect vehicle presence and provides visual guidance through LCD display, LEDs, and buzzer alerts.

## Problem Statement

Parking management in urban areas faces critical challenges:

- **Time wastage** — Drivers spend several minutes searching for free slots
- **Traffic congestion** — Unnecessary vehicle movement inside lots increases jams and fuel consumption
- **Manual monitoring** — Requires human supervision, prone to errors
- **User inconvenience** — No clear indication of slot availability leads to frustration
- **Safety concerns** — Illegal parking or overcrowding may cause accidents and disputes

---

## Solution

A smart parking guidance system using the **STM32F401CCU6 microcontroller** that detects vehicle presence through ultrasonic and IR sensors, displays real-time slot availability on an LCD, provides visual feedback via LEDs, and alerts users through a buzzer when parking is full or wrong entry is detected. The system is designed for efficient monitoring, reduced congestion, and improved user convenience.

## Working Principle

1. **Distance Detection** — Ultrasonic sensor continuously measures distance to incoming vehicles
2. **Proximity Classification** — System categorizes distance into three levels and activates corresponding LED
3. **Slot Monitoring** — Four IR sensors monitor individual parking slots independently
4. **Visual Feedback** — LCD displays distance and status; LEDs indicate slot occupancy
5. **Audio Alert** — Buzzer activates when vehicle is within 10 cm (Very Near)
6. **Serial Logging** — Real-time data sent via UART for monitoring and debugging

---

## System Operation

| Distance Range | LED Indicator | Buzzer | LCD Status |
|----------------|---------------|--------|------------|
| ≤ 10 cm | Near (ON) | Active | VERY NEAR |
| 11–20 cm | Medium (ON) | Off | MEDIUM |
| 21–35 cm | Far (ON) | Off | FAR |
| > 35 cm | All OFF | Off | CLEAR |

- **IR Sensor Detection** — When an IR sensor detects an obstacle (LOW signal), its corresponding LED turns ON
